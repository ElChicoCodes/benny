on startup

config_loaded bang
some config values are sent out individually but this is being phased out, as is 'request globals', do not use. just query (dict config)

play (1 or 0)
record (1 or 0)



REQUESTS

;to_blockmanager get_voice_details $1 <- the number from voice_is
gets you more info - total voices of block, your voiceno within block, etc

this is automatically sent to all voices once all blocks have loaded (eg when you load a song, or when you add a new block or voice) so no need to actually request it. it's also resent when any of the details change - eg if latching is turned on/off

;to_blockmanager create_blank_wave_buffer $1 <- wave slot number $2 <- length?
gets the js to get max to instantiate an empty buffer and give it a length, fills in the dictionary about it
the looper/softcut block sends this, then waits and checks again.


BLOCKS

all voices should send a 'getvoice' out of output 1 on load.
in return they'll get a voice_is - your actual voice (you can't get it yourself as you may or may not be wrapped in many layers of other things) - and voice_offset - where this voice finds its current parameter values in the buffer.

likewise normal max poly mute message mechanism has to work around it being wrapped - you'll get enable 1 / 0 messages to tell you if you're on or not. wrapper will unmute, bypass, upsample, etc for you. send your mute status (from thispoly) out of output 2



INTERNAL MECHANISMS

output_queue_pointer_reset bang
sets the read pointer on the output queue (hardware midi from modulation, and the sigs)
