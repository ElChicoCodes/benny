[BLOCKS MODE]

ctrl-A - select all
ctrl-C - copy
ctrl-X - cut
ctrl-V - paste (if nothing selected, pastes the blocks you copied. if you copied a single block, and the block selected is the same type, then paste pastes the parameters into your selected block. if a different single block is selected, paste swaps in the one you copied.)
ctrl-alt-V - superpaste, which is like paste but duplicating any connections outside the copied blocks that the original source had. for example, you have keyboard->voice->hardware out, if you copy just the voice block, ctrl-alt-V would paste in a new voice block with the same connections to keyboard and hardware out. it works with more complicated sets of blocks and connections too.
