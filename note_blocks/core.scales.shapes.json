You can make scales (dynamically if you want!) using midi input in two ways: ££For midi into the 'held' input the currently held notes are stored along with the order they were added. ££A phrase played into the 'pattern' input is turned into a list of notes and the order they were added. ££Scales can also span two octaves, if the scale you input is bigger than an octave then it treats it as being two.££You can edit scales by clicking the keyboard graphics in the ui, but at the moment you can't edit the order of a pattern that way.££The seq.shape.player can play back these patterns, various pitch quantisation blocks can use the stored lists of notes too. ££If you add more voices to this block you can have more stored scales and shapes.
